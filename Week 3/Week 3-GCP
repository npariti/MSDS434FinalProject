# MSDS 434 Project Week 3 GCP Set Up Cloud Bucket to Store Dataset
- To begin, within BigQuery, there was a schmea called 'austincrimedata' that was created. 
- The dataset that was used was a public datasets called 'Austin Crime' 
  - This was split into train (2014 and 2015 data) and predict (2016 data) 
- A GCP bucket  called 'austin-crime-data' was created to store the data 
- The data was then imported into a dataset within the 'austincrimedata' schema. To circumvent quotation issues within the records, "Quote newlines" was selected
